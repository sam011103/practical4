<b><i> Aroma Coffee is Malaysian chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Sungai Long, Kajang.
<br><br>
Our ultimate goal has always been to make speciality coffee accessible to everyone as a daily necessity. Speciality coffee is frequently regarded by many as a luxury, something you indulge in on special occasions. We sought to alter this impression.
<br><br>
Aroma Coffee is a cup of pure, reliable, and expertly brewed coffee. We are revolutionising the way people consume coffee by using the highest-quality ingredients, cutting-edge coffee brewing technology, and an inventive business strategy to make specialty coffee accessible to everyone, every day.
<br><br>
We thank all of the accomplishments thus far, as we have supplied more than 8.8 million cups to date. We were inspired to uphold our promise to you and ensure that Aroma Coffee is always available by your incredible loyalty and support.
<br><br>
As it has been from the beginning, our purpose goes far beyond profit. We believe Aroma Coffee can, and should, have a positive impact on the communities we serve.</b></i></p>
